# Poke-project

## Description
The aim of this project is to put into practice what has been learned in the LIFAP5 course by creating the client part of a POKEMON game application, entirely in JavaScript in the browser and without a server.

The application will enable you to manage pokemons: consult the pokemon catalog (a.k.a. Pokedex), choose the pokemons you want to place in your deck and face off against an opponent in a pokemon battle. The complete REST server (backend) and a starter version of the client are provided.
